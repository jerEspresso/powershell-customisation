- Create the following environment variable
  - Variable name: `MY_POSH_THEME`
  - Variable value: the path of the `my-posh-theme.omp.json` file in this repo
- The `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file needs to be put in the `Documents\Powershell` directory as the `$PROFILE` variable of Powershell
- Install one of the nerd fonts (e.g. CaskaydiaCove NF)
- [Optional] Install <b>Windows Terminal</b> (posh themes work better with it)
